# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This project was created to demonstrate my capabilities and knowledge of Bootstrap. Recreating a portfolio using the technology and adding it to my personaly portfolio so future visitors can see 'where I was' to 'where I have come'.

Along the way, this project taught me a whole lot about Bootstrap and just how useful it can be once you start to understand it. Using Bootstrap helped me save time since it gave me quick and easy access to premade component such as cards and access to their grid system to easiliy style my webpage.

Here's the live demo hosted on GitHub pages: https://mvpcurtis.github.io/bootstrap-portfolio/#contactme
